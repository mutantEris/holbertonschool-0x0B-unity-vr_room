I set up a VR Room. You can walk around in it, touch a few things. It is very much like an escape room, but there is no escape. 
I would like for this to be better, I may revisit this or recreate it as a whole, make it how I'd prefer to make it now that I've learned more. That would be interesting.

You may enter through the door. Touch the terminal to do so. Once inside, ignore the plants. Do not look at the plants.
There is a console in the middle, you may interact with it to create some sparkles, if you so wish.

The plants are mine. Do Not Touch Them.

Behold not the plants.
